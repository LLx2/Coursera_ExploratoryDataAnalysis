# Coursera_ExploratoryDataAnalysis
Coursera class on Data Science/ Exploratory Data Analyssis/  Week 1
*****************************************************************************************************************************
Data set is available here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip

*****************************************************************************************************************************
Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. Your task is to reconstruct the following plots below, all of which were constructed using the base plotting system.

* First you will need to fork and clone the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1

* For each plot you should:

  * Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
  * Name each of the plot files as 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟷.𝚙𝚗𝚐, 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟸.𝚙𝚗𝚐, etc.
  * Create a separate R code file (𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟷.𝚁, 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟸.𝚁, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟷.𝚁 constructs the 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝
    𝟷.𝚙𝚗𝚐 plot. Your code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reprodu
    ced. You must also include the code that creates the PNG file.
  * Add the PNG file and R code file to the top-level folder of your git repository (no need for separate sub-folders)
  * When you are finished with the assignment, push your git repository to GitHub so that the GitHub version of your repository is up to date. There should be four PNG files and four R code files, a total of eight files in the top-level folder of the repo.

Please note:
 The github repository @ https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1 has been forked:
   https://github.com/LLx2?tab=repositories
 
 All 4 charts have been assigned a width and height of 480 x 480. The common code for each of the 4, ".R" files at lines
 54:57 show this.
 
 4 files, named plot1.R...plot4.R are included. Code is included to read the data via common code at lines 32:37.  The code that creates the png files is available on all scripts (common code) lines 55:57.
 
 All 8 files are at top level folder of my git repo.
 
 There are 4 R code files, 4 png files and this "read - me" file.
